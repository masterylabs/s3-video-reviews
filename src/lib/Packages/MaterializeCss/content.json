Marathons provide a way for you to fast track your therapy, compacting 12 weeks of traditional weekly therapy into just two full days.</p><p>These intensives are ideal for working couples where time may be of essence. Our marathons are well suited for couples who may be dealing with additional relationship pressures and flow on effects from their work due vicarious trauma and / or compassion fatigue.</p><p>The frame work we use is purely evidence based therapy from over 40 years of Gottman research methods designed to rebuild weathered and torn relationships.</p><p>During marathons couples work through their difficulties, reshape their relationship by addressing their emotional injuries and learning to relate to each other differently through powerful conflict resolution strategies.</p><p>In a relatively short period of time couples can bring about needed change in resolving issues through effective interpersonal methods and psycho education on relationships. Couples are also provided with practical skills to carry on beyond therapy.</p><p>Our Couples Marathon provides you with an opportunity to heal from betrayal, restore lost connection, trust and commitment. Learn how to communicate in a way that brings you closer together reigniting your passion and strengthening your bond to one another.</p>"
